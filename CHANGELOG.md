0.1.0 / 2013-11-1X
==================
  * first tentative release - factored out of groupstage 0.4.0 and hammered until independent and good
  * lots of fixes and improvements since then: demotion algorithm, positioning, generality
  * initialization uses a specialized `.from` that makes everything work under the covers
  * other tournament can indicate compatibility by implementing ::rawPositions and we will break on them when needed
